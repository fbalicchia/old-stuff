## Access Watch output filter

Web traffic insights and robot detection are key for teams to stay in control of what is happening on their infrastructure and web assets. Automated robotic traffic now represents a larger share of website activity over human customers. These bots have a significant impact, with many working hard to disguise their identity and activity, thereby increasing risk and costs while harming performance for online businesses. Access Watch deploys the industryâ€™s most precise robot intelligence to be easily plugged into any existing data pipeline.

This plugin provides a seamless integration with the [Access Watch](https://access.watch/reveal) service to all [Sematext](https://sematext.com) clients. 

Example config to enrich Nginx web server logs with Access Watch robot information (requires [Access Watch API key](https://access.watch/reveal) and [Sematext Logsene](https://sematext.com/logsene) Token):

```yaml

options:
  includeOriginalLine: false # don't log original log line
  printStats: 60             # print stats every minute
  maxInputRate: 1mb          # per second

input:
  files:
      - '/var/log/nginx/access_log'

outputFilter:
  - module: access-watch
