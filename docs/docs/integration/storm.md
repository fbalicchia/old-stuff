## Metrics

Metric Name | Key | Agg | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
supervisors | storm.supervisors | Avg | Long | The number of Nodes in the cluster currently.
topologies | storm.topologies | Avg | Long | The number of Topologies in the cluster currently.
slots | storm.slots | Avg | Long | Total slots are Workers (processes).
used slots | storm.slots.used | Avg | Long | Busy slots are Workers (processes).
acked | storm.bolts.tuples.acked | Sum | Long | The number of Tuples acknowledged by this Bolt.
failed | storm.bolts.tuples.failed | Sum | Long | The number of Tuples failed by this Bolt.
executed | storm.bolts.tuples.executed | Sum | Long | The number of incoming Tuples processed.
executors | storm.executors | Avg | Long | Executors are threads in a Worker process.
state spouts | storm.spouts.state | Avg | Long | The number of State Spouts.
bolts | storm.bolts | Avg | Long | The number of Bolts.
workers | storm.workers | Avg | Long | The number of Workers (processes).
spouts | storm.spouts | Avg | Long | The number of Spouts.
tasks | storm.tasks | Avg | Long | A Task is an instance of a Bolt or Spout.            The number of Tasks is almost always equal to the number of Executors.
emitted | storm.bolts.tuples.emitted | Sum | Long | The number of Tuples emitted.
transferred | storm.bolts.tuples.transferred | Sum | Long | The number of Tuples emitted that sent to one or more Bolts.
acked | storm.sputs.tuples.acked | Sum | Long | The number of Tuple 'trees' successfully processed.            A value of 0 is expected if no acking is done.
failed | storm.sputs.tuples.failed | Sum | Long | The number of Tuple 'trees' that were explicitly           failed or timed out before acking was completed.           A value of 0 is expected if no acking is done.
emitted | storm.sputs.tuples.emitted | Sum | Long | The number of Tuples emitted.
transferred | storm.sputs.tuples.transferred | Sum | Long | The number of Tuples emitted that sent to one or more Bolts.
