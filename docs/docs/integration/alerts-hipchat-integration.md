## In HipChat

1.  Navigate to Rooms / YOUR ROOM NAME / Tokens and create a new token.
    NOTE: we support OAuth2 and not OAuth1 tokens.

    "HipChat Notification Token")
    
    **Note:** If you already have a HipChat token, please check whether
    it contains only lower case letters. If so, it is probably an OAuth1
    token.  We support only OAuth2 tokens.  Please create OAuth2 token
    as described above. 
    
    **Note:** There are two possible ways to create HipChat OAuth2
    token: 
    
    A) Under room as described above. If you use this you will see
    messages from SPM with the nickname you define in the Token Label
    input.  
    B) Under user
    via [https://hipchat.com/account/api](https://sematexttest.hipchat.com/account/api).
    If you use this option you will see all messages from SPM with you
    own nickname.   
      

2.  Copy the HipChat Room Token because you'll need to paste it in later
    (see below).

       **Note:** You could add Room Id or Room Name. Both options are possible.

    -  Click the “Test” button and when HipChat returns status code 200 or
       204 you will know everything is configured correctly. Check your
       HipChat channel for the test message from Sematext.

        -  To enable alerting to HipChat activate the “Enabled” checkbox, as
           shown in the screenshot above.

        -  Click the “Save” button.

That's it. Notifications sent to HipChat can also be sent via other
channels such as e-mail, PagerDuty, Nagios, Slack, custom Web Hook, etc.
- at the same time, the alert is displayed in the SPM event graph to
overlay it with the triggering metrics:
