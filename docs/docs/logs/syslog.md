## Essentials

We support receiving syslog messages from any application, as long as
they comply to either [RFC-3164](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164) or
[RFC-5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) (and
[RFC-5425](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425) for TLS). The
destination host is **logsene-receiver-syslog.sematext.com** / **logsene-receiver-syslog.eu.sematext.com** (if using Sematext Cloud Europe) and ports
we use are:

  - for Syslog over UDP: **514**
  - for Syslog over TCP: **514**
  - for Syslog over TLS: **10514** (get [root certificate](https://apps.sematext.com/cert/DigiCert_Global_Root_CA.pem) and [intermediate certificate](https://apps.sematext.com/cert/DigiCertCA.pem) to get
    TLS working)
  - for RELP: **20514**

### Authorization

There are two ways to authorize when you send logs. Authorizing means
telling Logsene which Logsene App to send logs to. We recommend you
embed your Logsene App token in your syslog daemon's config in a
[CEE-formatted JSON message](json-messages-over-syslog).
Step-by-step instructions for [rsyslog](rsyslog) and
[syslog-ng](syslog-ng),
and a raw example are below.

Alternatively, [authorize your public IPs](authorizing-ips-for-syslog) and then send messages
directly.  Note that configuring your log shipper to send your Logsene
App token is preferred to authorizing source IPs. You can see specific
instructions for [rsyslog](rsyslog),
[syslog-ng](syslog-ng) and [syslogd](syslogd)
for how to forward messages in this case.  

## Example

A quick way to ship messages via TCP syslog is with
netcat:

``` bash
echo 'my-host my-process:@cee: {"logsene-app-token": "LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE", "message": "hello world2!"}' | nc logsene-receiver-syslog.sematext.com 514
```

## Ways to Ship Logs

In production, you're probably going to use a syslog daemon. Details on
configuring syslog daemons to send logs over TCP/UDP/RELP are below:

  - [rsyslog](rsyslog)
  - [syslog-ng](syslog-ng)
  - [traditional syslogd](syslogd)

### TLS Encryption

In addition to TCP, UDP and RELP, Logsene also supports RFC-5425
compliant Syslog over TLS. See instructions for
[rsyslog](rsyslog) and
[syslog-ng](syslog-ng) on how to configure them.

### HTTP or HTTPS

If you use a recent version of rsyslog (6.4.0 or later), you might want
to send logs directly to [Logsene's Elasticsearch API](index-events-via-elasticsearch-api), through the
[omelasticsearch module](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/omelasticsearch.html). Details on how
to do that are on the [rsyslog howto page](rsyslog).
