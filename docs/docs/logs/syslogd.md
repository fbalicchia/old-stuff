With plain syslogd, you can send logs to Logsene via UDP if you add this
line to your **/etc/syslog.conf**:

``` bash
*.* @logsene-receiver-syslog.sematext.com
```

Before you restart syslogd,Â **[register your public IP](authorizing-ips-for-syslog).** If you're behind a NAT
or registering IPs doesn't suit your use-case, there are other options:

  - if you just want to test sending a few logs to Logsene, you can use
    your Logsene application token in a [CEE-formatted JSON message](json-messages-over-syslog). For
example:

<!-- end list -->

``` bash
logger '@cee: {"logsene-app-token": "LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE", "message": "hello world!"}'
```

  - change your syslog daemon from syslogd to
    [rsyslog](rsyslog) or
    [syslog-ng](syslog-ng). Or anything else that lets you
    format your messages, so you can build a JSON containing your
    Logsene application token like the one above
  - similar to the solution above, you can use a separate machine for
    consolidating your logs, where you'd install rsyslog or syslog-ng.
    Configure that machine to send logs to Logsene, and configure your
    syslogd to send logs to your logs to your "central"
    rsyslog/syslog-ng via UDP:

<!-- end list -->

``` bash
*.* @central-syslog-server
```

If your central machine is running syslog-ng, you'll have to add an
[udp() option](http://www.balabit.com/sites/default/files/documents/syslog-ng-ose-3.3-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-v3.3-guide-admin-en/html/reference_source_tcpudp.html)
to your [source() statement](syslog-ng/#configure-sources)
in **/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf**:

``` bash
udp()
```

If your central machine is running rsyslog, you'll have to load the [UDP input module](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/imudp.html) and run it on the
standard **port 514**:

``` bash
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514
```
