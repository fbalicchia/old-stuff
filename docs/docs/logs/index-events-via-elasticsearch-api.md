## The Essentials

With Logsene, we expose the [Elasticsearch API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/) so you can:

  - send log events through it directly from your application, using
    any [Elasticsearch library](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/community/current/clients.html)
  - send log events by using existing application such as
    [Logstash](logstash), or [Apache Flume](http://flume.apache.org/), or [Fluentd Elasticsearch plugin](https://github.com/uken/fluent-plugin-elasticsearch), or
     anything that can output to Elasticsearch. Or you can implement
    your own "log shipper".
  - [search for logs from your own application](search-through-the-elasticsearch-api), or
    by configuring/adapting existing Elasticsearch UIs, such as
    [Kibana](faq/#can-i-run-kibana-4-locally-and-point-it-to-logsene)
  - optionally define [custom mappings](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/) for
    your log types, so you can tweak the way your logs are indexed

When you use the API, here are the things you need to know:

  - host name: **logsene-receiver.sematext.com** / **logsene-receiver.eu.sematext.com** (only is using Sematext Cloud Europe)
  - port: **80** or **443** (depending on whether you want to use plain HTTP or HTTPS)**  
    **
  - index name: your [Logsene app token](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs) -
    note: **this token should be kept secret** (n.b. you can have N Logsene Apps, each with its own token)

## Indexing

With the same REST API, you can index logs directly from your own
application, or you can craft your own "log sender". 

**NOTE:**  
If you are sending logs from your application use the Elasticsearch HTTP
API. If you are sending logs from a Java application use a library like
[log4j2-elasticsearch-http](https://github.com/jprante/log4j2-elasticsearch-http)[ or ](https://github.com/jprante/log4j2-elasticsearch-http)[Jest](https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest) [instead of Elasticsearch TransportClient.](https://github.com/jprante/log4j2-elasticsearch-http)

  

Besides specifying your Logsene app token as the index name, it's nice
to have a field named "@timestamp".  Its value should be a valid
[ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) timestamp. This will
be used for searching and sorting when/if you use Kibana with Logsene.
If you don't provide a timestamp, Logsene will add one when it receives
your message.

For example, you can send a log like this:

``` bash
NOW=`date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"`
curl -XPOST https://logsene-receiver.sematext.com/$YOUR_TOKEN_HERE/mytype/ -d '
{
  "@timestamp": "'$NOW'",
  "message": "Hello World!"
}'
```

This will index a simple "hello world" message to Logsene. That event
would have the current timestamp and will go to your Logsene app
(provided that the $YOUR\_TOKEN\_HERE variable contains your token),
within a type named "mytype". The type is a logical division of events.
Typically, you'd put events with different structures in different
types. For example, syslog messages in a type called "syslog", apache
logs in a type called "apache". Essentially, the type can be anything,
it's the token of your application that has to match.

For performance reasons, we highly recommend using the [Bulk API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/bulk.html),
because it allows you to send multiple events with a single request. For
example, the following request sends three events:

``` bash
NOW=`date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"`

echo '{ "index" : { "_index": "LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE", "_type" : "mytype" } }
{ "@timestamp": "'$NOW'", "severity_numeric" : 1 }
{ "index" : { "_index": "LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE", "_type" : "mytype" } }
{ "@timestamp": "'$NOW'", "message" : "hello again" }
{ "index" : { "_index": "LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE", "_type" : "mytype" } }
{ "@timestamp": "'$NOW'", "alternate_message": "fields can be added and removed at will" }' > req

curl -XPOST https://logsene-receiver.sematext.com/_bulk --data-binary @req; echo
```

## Default Log Index Mapping

A
[mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#mapping)
is a way to define how your logs are indexed - which fields are in each
log event and how each field is indexed. Logsene provides a default
mapping that works well for most use-cases:

  - the **@timestamp** field is an
    [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date
  - the **geoip** field is an object that contains a **location** [geo point](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-point.html)
    field (this works well if you're using
    [Logstash](logstash))
  - the predefined fields **host**, **facility**, **severity**,
    **syslog-tag**, **source** and **tags** **** are not analyzed, which
    enables only exact matches (you can still use wildcards, for example
    to search for **web-server\*** and get **web-server01**)
  - all string fields are analyzed by whitespace and lowercased by
    default, enabling a search for **message:hello** to match an event
    with **Hello World** in the **message** field

## Custom Log Index Mapping

If the default log index fields (also known as index mapping) don't fit
your needs you can create completely custom index mapping. See [Custom Logsene Mapping Template How-To](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/01/20/custom-elasticsearch-index-templates-in-logsene/).
 Note that if you have N different log structures, the best way to
handle that is by creating N Logsene Apps, each with its own index
mapping.  For example, you may have web server logs, your system logs in
/var/log/messages, and your custom application logs.  Each of these 3
types of logs has a different structure.  The web server logs probably
use Apache Common Log format, the logs in /var/log/messages have syslog
structure, and your own application's logs can be in any format your
application happens to use.  To handle all 3 log formats elegantly
simply create 3 separate Logsene Apps and use a different format for
each of them.  See [Custom Logsene Mapping Template How-To](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/01/20/custom-elasticsearch-index-templates-in-logsene/) for
details.
