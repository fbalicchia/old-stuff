Logsene looks for the following fields in logs and gives them a special
treatment:

  - host
  - source
  - facility
  - severity
  - syslog-tag
  - tags
  - message
  - @timestamp 

**host** is a single-valued field and should contain the ID (typically a
hostname) of the device or server sending logs.

**source** is a single-valued field and should contain the ID or
descriptor of where the data is coming from.  For example, this could be
a file name or even a full path to a filename, or the name of the
application or process.

**facility** is a single-valued field used by syslog to indicate the
[facility level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility_levels).
Logsene stores the keyword values of these levels (such as *user* or
*auth*).

**severity** ** is a single-valued field and should contain the log
level, such as *error* or *info*.

**syslog-tag** is a single-valued field used by syslog to indicate the
name and the PID of the application generating the event (for example,
**httpd\[215\]:** )

**tags** is a multi-valued array field that can contain zero or more
tags.  Tags can contain multiple tokens separated by space.

**message** is a string field that can contain any sort of text (usually
the original log line or some other free text)

**@timestamp** is a date field, on which log retention is based. If it's
not present, Logsene will add a timestamp upon event receipt

  

All of these fields are optional, but their use is strongly encouraged.
 If found in logs with low-enough cardinality, all distinct values of
these fields will be loaded and shown in the UI as filters and thus
allowing one to very quickly narrow down the search.
