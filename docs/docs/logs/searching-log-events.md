By connecting to port **80** (or 443, if you want HTTPS)
on **logsene-receiver.sematext.com** / **logsene-receiver-syslog.eu.sematext.com** (if using Sematext Cloud Europe), you can use the Elasticsearch API to search
through your data, in the same way [you can send it](sending-log-events).

Logsene comes with its own UI, which integrates nicely with other Sematext Apps, such as [SPM](http://sematext.com/spm/) (seeÂ [Monitoring Documentation](../monitoring/coda-hale-metrics-reporter)). You can also use [Kibana](kibana). Or deploy your own UI or custom scripts.

Besides web UI, there's also [Logsene CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logsene-cli), a command line interface for searching through logs, with the ability to pipe the output to `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort` and other useful shell commands.
See [Logsene CLI Introduction](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/07/07/logsene-cli/).
